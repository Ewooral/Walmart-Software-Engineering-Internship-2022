### A relation(table)
    is a set of Tuples(rows)

* Each element in a tuple(cell value) is a member of a data domain(set of allowed values)
* These elements are called attribute values, and are associated with an **attribute** (column name + type)

### Schema
    is the shape or structure of one's data (as opposed to values themselves)

* these are the Tables, column names, types and constraints
* Strongly connected to your data domain
